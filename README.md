# Alcove

## The Manifesto: Alcove
Alcove is a minimalist, contemplative reading companion built for the deep-focused reader. Unlike modern reading platforms that utilize dopamine-driven streaks and social pressures, Alcove is designed as a "digital sanctuary"—a warm, dark-academia-inspired space to track progress and reflections without the noise.

### 1. Core Philosophy
Quietude over Gamification: No countdowns, no competitive leaderboards. Just your books and your thoughts.

Intentional Design: A "Grand Entry" experience that transitions into a cozy, plant-filled dashboard.

The Digital Commonplace: Merging the utility of a book tracker with the soul of a private journal.

### 2. Technical Pedigree
The architecture is built upon the Laravel Ecosystem, chosen for its elegance and "developer happiness."

Framework: Laravel 11 (The Sturdy Foundation)

Auth: Laravel Breeze (The Secure Entryway)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (The Aesthetic Layer - Dark Academia Palette)

Database: MySQL (The Stacks)
